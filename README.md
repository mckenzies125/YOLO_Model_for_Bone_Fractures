The goal of this project was to train a neural network to solve a problem of our choosing. My group and I decided to train a YOLO model to classify the location of, if any, fractured bones in an x-ray. After uploading the data, generating our "y" values (a vector of information about the location of the fracture), and splitting the data into a train and test set, we trained our model. We used a hyperparameter finder and data augmentation to optimize the performance of the YOLO model. We concluded with a precision of 85% and a recall of 48%. I primarily worked on the hyperparameter finder and the data augmentation. I contributed to all of the text portions of our code, though I was the sole contributer to the description of the YOLO model.  

This  project was submitted as the final assignment for, "Introduction to Deep Learning." (DIDA-340)
